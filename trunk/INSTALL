These are generic installation instructions.

Requirements
============

- A generic Linux compilation environment, mine is Ubuntu 11.10:
   $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake bash bison bzip2 \
   diffutils file flex g++ gawk groff libncurses-dev libtool \
   libslang2 make patch perl sed shtool subversion tar texinfo \
   zlib1g zlib1g-dev git-core gettext libexpat1-dev

- At least 15Gb of disk space,
- Approx. 5 hours of free time to compile all stuff.

Building
========

$ mkdir ~/openwrt
$ cd ~/openwrt
$ svn co http://wl500g-repo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ./rtn
$ cd ./rtn
$ make

    Building repo goes through a several stages:
- downloading firmware sources from http://code.google.com/p/wl500g/
- configuring firmware according to http://code.google.com/p/wl500g/wiki/CompilingCustomFirmware?wl=en
- downloading, patching and compiling toolchain from http://code.google.com/p/wl500g/source/browse/#svn%2Ftoolchain
- deploying and patching OpenWRT Buildroot, refer to http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/toolchain
- compiling software packages

    If building fails, see whats wrong in a current target from Makefile.

    ipk-packages can be found at ~/openwrt/bin/entware/packages directory.
    Scripts was tested with following OpenWRT revisions:

- OpenWRT buildroot revision 31158,
- OpenWRT packages feed revision 31158.
