=== Known bugs and odds, to do list ===

ARM feed is coming?

sshd: syslogin_perform_logout: logout() returned an error, /var/... or /etc/... somewhere in sources
bash_completion: /etc/bashcompletion in optware is newer
freeswitch: spandsp marked as broken for now.
elfutils: is a fake package for now, still old libelf package used due to our 2.6 kernel
libpam: market as @BROKEN, too many packages will fail to build otherwise
