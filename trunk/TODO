===Known Bugs and odds, to do list===

The main problem is a cyrillic UTF-8 support in ncurses-based console application. Its due to UCLIBC_HAS_LOCALE=n in toolchain. Is there any workaround?
bash: ncurses vs libiconv linking
minidlna: update
sshd: syslogin_perform_logout: logout() returned an error, /var/... or /etc/... somewhere in sources
bash_completion: /etc/bashcompletion in optware is newer
alsa-lib: edit config files
mysql-server: /opt/lib/upgrade is unneeded
asterisk: /opt/etc/default /opt/etc/init.d is unneeded
netatalk: config files fix
grep from busybox is not full
bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (ru_RU.UTF-8)
microdc2: cyrillic support
usbip: untested
