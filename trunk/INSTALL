These are generic installation instructions.

Prerequisites
=============

    Before using this scripts you need to install two basic instruments:
1) OpenWRT Buildroot. Follow original instructions from http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence

$ mkdir ~/openwrt
$ cd openwrt
$ svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/
$ cd trunk
$ ./scripts/feeds update -a
$ ./scripts/feeds install -a

2) Oleg's based firmware toolchain from http://code.google.com/p/wl500g/downloads/list

$ mkdir -p /opt/brcm
$ wget http://wl500g.googlecode.com/files/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc-4.4.6-K26-x86_64-r3458.tar.bz2
$ tar -C /opt/brcm -jxvf hndtools-mipsel-uclibc-4.4.6-K26-x86_64-r3458.tar.bz2
$ ln -sf /opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc-4.4.6-K2.6 /opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc

Configurations
==============

    Now use this scripts to configure OpenWRT Buildroot.

$ cd ~/openwrt
$ svn co http://wl500g-repo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ./rtn
$ cd ./rtn
$ make

    Scripts uses Makefile to proceed several steps:
1) Applying new target "rtn" to OpenWRT Buildroot.
2) Patching paths in several OpenWRT packages. Only few packages will be built. The more packages will be tested the more will be included in future.
3) Patching OpenWRT Buildroot to adapt OpenWRT path scheme (/usr/local/bin, /etc) to Optware scheme (/opt/bin, /opt/etc) and configuring Buildroot to use external toolchain and mark several ONLY few number of packages to compile. Its firmware specific.
    This steps you can run manually by entering: make rtn_target && make patch_packages && make buildroot_config from ~/optware/rtn directory.

Building
========

    Use OpenWRT Buildroot to compile selected packages.

$ cd ~/openwrt/trunk
$ make package/compile

    ipk-packages can be found at ~/openwrt/bin directory.
    Scripts was tested with folowing buildroot revisions

- buildroot revision is 28672
- openwrt packages revision is 7845
- xwrt feed revision is 4986
- luci feed revision is 7845
